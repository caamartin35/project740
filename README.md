## Base-Delta Compression with Memory Pooling

This is a research project for CMU 18-740.


### Config

You can alter various cache paramters in the `lib/config.h` file. If you modify this file, you will have to `make clean` and rebuild each simulator.


### Data

In the `data/` directory you can `driver.py` to run all traces on each simulator. To save the results, just send `stdout` to a new text file.
